<h1>Rook E3</h1>

<h2> W.I.P! not 100% ready yet. </h2>

<p>This is my mod for the Rook 2020 to make it use all the parts from an Ender 3 V2.<br />
<p>This needs an aditional z-motor and leadscrew</p>
<br />
Extrusion lengths are: 10x350mm for top and bottom frame +2 for the bed and 4x400mm for the Z-axis. the bed needs a 250 extrusion, there is a 4040 on the ender you can use.<br />
<br />
This gives you a build-volume of 230x230x300<br />
<br />

<p>Uses 2x 350mm MGN9C rails on Y, and one 300mm MGN9C on X</p>
<p>4x 8x400mm Rods for the Z axis</p>
<br/>
<p>Supports the stock Ender 3 electronics and can use Marlin with a custom firmware.</p>

<br />
Please note that this has not been built yet, let me know if you want to build it!</p>
